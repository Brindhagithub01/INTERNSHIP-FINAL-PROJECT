# INTERNSHIP-FINAL-PROJECT
INTRODUCTION:
A Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) company entered into the instant noodles business two years back. Their higher management has noticed that there is a mismatch in the demand and supply. Where the demand is high, supply is pretty low and vice-versa which results in a loss in inventory cost and ultimately loss to the company. Hence, the higher management wants to optimize the supply quantity in each and every warehouse in the entire country.

Objective
The objective of this exercise is to build a model, using historical data that will determine 
an optimum weight of the product to be shipped each time from the respective warehouse and 
Perform thorough data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis , and feature engineering and 
use multiple machine learning algorithms.Finally Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.These are features include in the dataset......
